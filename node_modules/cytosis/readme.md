- Include cytosis.js with a CDN or locally into static sites and platforms like Squarespace and Wordpress

- [add usage notes here]


## Production Notes

- Use webpack `npm run build` to create a single JS file for CDNs or local file import w/o the need for Node. 
- Publish a demo site on surge w/ link to surge asset as CDN
- Publish changes as npm modules for easy npm integration
