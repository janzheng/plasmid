#### 0.0.3

- made lots of functions static
- added dynamic rows to init, can specify what row in _cytosis to pull from now
- changed from .get() to .fields[] to get away from using the prototype
- added getFieldValues
- changed search() to comb through multiple list of strings
- added getNames to get flat list of row names
- started to add better comments on functions w/ input/output
- changed key/base names to airKey and airBase
- made get() synchronous
- added linked column search to Find(), e.g. TableName.RecordName.ColName.LinkedColName
- changed split / unsplit behavior to not affect user too much
  - user still has to save each new split field to Airtable
  - can now unsplit Airtable data and data will appear "normal"
- changed the way getTables is accessed: takes a single object arg now
- mostly stable

#### 0.0.212

- Changed saveLinkedTable to not static



#### 0.0.211

- Changed cytosis.data to cytosis.config; all the table data is stored in cytosis.tables now
- Added a stub for a join method, but I don't really have it planned out nor any use of it, so it doesn't do much

#### 0.0.210

- Rewrote from mimicking airtable API's special Class implementation to ES6 syntactic classes
- Added a join method for combining multiple tables and fields into a new object (API doesn't have table creation, so currently can't write joined objects into a new table)
- Divided functionality into methods and static methods 

#### Previous

- Previously changes unlogged, work was mostly proof of concept and making sure things worked
